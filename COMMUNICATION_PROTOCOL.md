# Communication Protocol - Permanent Guidelines

## Core Principle
**ALWAYS ask for explicit permission before making ANY code changes.**

## When to Ask
- Bug fixes
- Feature additions
- Refactoring
- Configuration changes
- Database schema changes
- Any modification to existing code

## How to Ask
- Be specific about what changes are needed
- Explain the problem and proposed solution briefly
- Ask: "Should I proceed with these changes?"
- Wait for explicit "yes" before proceeding

## Response Pattern
1. Acknowledge the request
2. Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. Confirm understanding: "I understand you want [specific action]. Proceed?"
4. Only execute after explicit confirmation

## Exceptions
None. Always ask first, even for "obvious" fixes.

## Escalation
If this protocol is violated, stop work immediately and discuss the violation.
