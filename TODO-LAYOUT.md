# Layout Improvements TODO

## Task: Add Layout Toggle Switch

### Requirements:
- Toggle switch between two modes:
  1. **Default Mode**: Original narrow layout (max-w-4xl, vertical stacking)
  2. **Grid Mode**: Wide layout with draggable elements that snap to grid

### Features to Implement:
- Toggle button in top corner
- Default to narrow mode on page load
- CSS classes for both layout modes
- JavaScript to switch between modes
- Grid snapping functionality when in grid mode
- Draggable elements (Track/Car/Drivers, Garage61 lap times, Race inputs, etc.)
- Remember user preference (localStorage)

### Current Status:
- Garage61 integration working perfectly
- Driver filtering implemented correctly
- Ready to add layout toggle functionality

### Next Steps:
1. Add toggle button UI
2. Create CSS for both layout modes
3. Implement drag-and-drop with grid snapping
4. Add JavaScript mode switching
5. Test on different screen sizes
