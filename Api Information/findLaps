GET /api/v1/laps
Find laps and lap records.

Required permissions:
driving_data
Search for laps or lap records.

This method takes a lot of parameters and allows you to find laps or lap records. To get a good idea at the kind of filtering you can do, read the documentation on lap filtering first.

You will always need to supply at least a track, a car or a user.

To map the filtering capabilities of the app on the parameters below, here's an overview on which parameters are used for each filter in the app:

Group laps: group
Drivers / teams: drivers, teams, extraDrivers
Session type: sessionTypes
Setup: sessionSetupTypes
Related data: seeTelemetry, seeGhostLap, seeSetup
Lap type: lapTypes
Date driven: age, after
Lap time: minLapTime, maxLapTime
Driver Rating: minRating, maxRating
Fuel level: minFuel, maxFuel, minFuelUsed, maxFuelUsed
Track conditions: minConditionsTrackUsage, maxConditionsTrackUsage, minConditionsTrackWetness, maxConditionsTrackWetness, minConditionsTrackTemp, maxConditionsTrackTemp, minConditionsAirTemp, maxConditionsAirTemp, minConditionsWindVel, maxConditionsWindVel, minConditionsRelativeHumidity, maxConditionsRelativeHumidity, minConditionsFogLevel, maxConditionsFogLevel, minConditionsPrecipitation, maxConditionsPrecipitation, minConditionsCloud, maxConditionsCloud, conditionsWindDir
Limitations
This method only returns laps driven yourself or your team mates. Use the relevant parameters to choose the desired selection of laps. For privacy reasons, no global lap search is available.

Data returned adheres to the defined privacy settings and is thus specific to the user linked to the API token.
