# Pre-Drivers Tab Backup
**Created**: 2025-10-23 18:23:08  
**Purpose**: Complete snapshot before implementing the "Drivers" tab feature in the weather component

## Overview
This backup captures the **fully working state** of the RadianPlanner application before any modifications for adding a third "Drivers" tab to the weather component.

## Files Backed Up

### HTML Structure
- **index.html** - Main application page with weather component containers

### JavaScript Modules
- **app.js** - Main application orchestrator (weather component initialization)
- **weather-component.js** - Weather component with Temperature & Clouds tabs
- **strategy-calculator.js** - Strategy calculations and stint table generation

### Styling
- **main.css** - All application styles including weather component styling

## What This Feature Addresses

### Original Request
Add a third "Drivers" tab to the weather component that:
- Shows stint-based timeline (X-axis = stint duration, not hours)
- Displays driver colors matching the stint table
- Maintains day/night background overlay at lower opacity
- Aligns visually with the stint table for better planning context

### Why This Backup
- The weather component is critical to the application
- Changes would affect both Page 1 (session selection) and Page 2 (strategy display)
- This backup allows safe rollback if any issues arise
- Provides a known-good reference point for comparison

## Rollback Instructions

If the implementation causes issues, restore these files to their original locations:

```powershell
# From the backup directory:
Copy-Item app.js ../../public/js/ -Force
Copy-Item index.html ../../ -Force
Copy-Item weather-component.js ../../public/js/modules/ -Force
Copy-Item strategy-calculator.js ../../public/js/modules/ -Force
Copy-Item main.css ../../public/css/ -Force
```

Or restore from Git:
```bash
git checkout main -- public/js/ public/css/ index.html
```

## Implementation Plan

The "Drivers" tab will be added to `weather-component.js` with:

1. **New Tab Button**: "Drivers" (in addition to Temperature and Clouds)
2. **New Chart**: `renderDriversChart()` method
3. **Data Requirements**:
   - Stint timing data (startTime, endTime per stint)
   - Driver assignments (driver name per stint)
   - Driver color mapping (matching stint table colors)
4. **Chart Configuration**:
   - X-axis: Stint-based timeline (stint 1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - Y-axis: Driver color bands (full height)
   - Background: Optional day/night overlay (low opacity)

## Testing Checklist

Before considering the implementation complete:

- [ ] Page 1 weather display still loads correctly
- [ ] Page 2 weather component still loads correctly
- [ ] Temperature tab still renders correctly
- [ ] Clouds & Precipitation tab still renders correctly
- [ ] New "Drivers" tab renders without errors
- [ ] Drivers tab shows correct stint timeline
- [ ] Drivers tab displays correct driver colors
- [ ] Day/night background shows correctly
- [ ] Tab switching works smoothly
- [ ] Chart resizes properly on window resize
- [ ] Stint table colors match driver chart colors
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools

## Notes

- This backup is isolated and does not affect the working application
- All original functionality remains intact
- The backup directory can be deleted once the feature is stable (recommended after 1 week of production testing)
